### Insights
The Blue Card dominates with 46M in revenue, contributing the largest share compared to other card categories like Silver (5.5M), Gold (2.5M), and Platinum (1.1M). Blue cards generated 46M, making them very popular among customers.

Most revenue (35M) comes from swipe transactions, far surpassing chip-based (17M) and online transactions (3M).
This suggests that physical card use is more common than digital transactions. There might be an opportunity to incentivize online usage for higher convenience.

#### Customer behaviors based on segments
Education Level: Customers with a degree generated 22M in revenue, the highest among all education groups, followed by high school graduates (11M). This shows that highly educated customers are the most profitable.

Occupational group: Entrepreneurs contributed 17M in revenue, higher than other groups, such as white-collar workers (10M) and retirees (5M). This may indicate that credit cards are used extensively by professional customers with higher incomes.

#### Spending is Driven by Necessities
Bills (14M) and Entertainment (10M) dominate expenditure types, followed by fuel, grocery, and food, all around $9M each.
This highlights customers' reliance on credit cards for both essential and leisure spending, showing a balanced use across needs and wants.

#### Revenue per quarter
Revenue is relatively evenly distributed between the quarters (13M-14M), but the number of transactions increased slightly in Q4 with 167K transactions. This may indicate an increase during holiday periods.

#### Conclusion
The data highlights the dominance of Blue Card users and swipe transactions, with spending driven by daily necessities. Business professionals and graduates are the key customer segments, offering clear targets for future growth strategies.

### Insights
Gender distribution: In total there are 30M male and 25M female customers, which indicates a slightly higher representation of men.
Age groups:
Customers between 40-50 account for the highest revenue (14M), followed by 50-60 year olds (10M).
Younger customers (20–30 years) account for the least revenue (5M), which may indicate lower credit utilization in that group.
Average age: The average age of the customer base is 46 years, which shows that middle-aged individuals are the most active users.

Married customers contribute the most revenue (15M), while singles account for 12M. It suggests that married individuals often have higher credit card usage, possibly for family needs.

The income varies but has a stable trend between 1M–1.5M per month. Seasonal variations occur, with peaks seen in specific months, which may be due to holiday or shopping periods.

Total income is 588M, while interest generated is 8M, indicating that customers are largely paying off their balances.

Highly educated customers (PhD, Masters) generate lower revenue than expected (3M–4M), while customers with a degree contribute the most (12M). This suggests that the focus should be on attracting highly educated customers with customized products.

### Recommendations (Conclusion)
My recommendations from the data would be:
- Focus on high-wage groups and business owners because customize premium cards and benefits for these customers to further increase their loyalty.
- Increase engagement among younger customers. Create products and marketing aimed at younger generations (ages 20-30) to broaden the user base.
- Take advantage of monthly peaks by launching promotions during peak activity times.
- Strengthen efforts in top states such as California, New York and Texas, where revenue and customer volumes are highest.
